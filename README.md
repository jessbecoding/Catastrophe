# CATASTROPHE: A Python Text Adventure Game

Catastrophe, like many things in my life, was inspired by my pets. I've created Catastrophe using Python. I utilized my knowledge of if statements to navigate the player through choices that determine the outcome of the game. The actual combat logic uses a while loop to determine if the enemy's health is below 0 that you'll win the game and break the loop. If you do not make the right choices in the game, it will lead to an instant death.

## Installation

First, you'll want to download Python <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">here</a>. Follow the installation prompts and instal the latest version of Python. You'll also want the Python extension in VS Code.

## Running The Game

If you're using VS Code, you should see a play button on the top left corner of your window. You may have to press this twice to get the game going.
